## Index

2.24.25 - [chatbot-with-memory.py](/samples/chatbot-with-memory.py) is a recently released script that deploys a powerful memory capable agent to store conversations for later analysis. It also uses recursive recalling to build memory states from summaries of previous memory states (An inception of LLM agents, one summarizing and another interacting with the user).  

[STT_AI.ipynb](/samples/STT_AI.pynb) is a jupyter notebook that contains a working sample of the Speech to Text LLM summarization task. (Currently tested and working.)\
\
[Tinytroupe_analyzer.py](/samples/Tinytroupe_analyzer.py) is an exercise in using Microsoft's TinyTroupe to deploy agent brainstorming sessions. This is purely for educational purposes only.\
\
[Vision_AI.pynb](/samples/Vision_AI.pynb) is a jupyter notebook that contains a working sample of the Open AI Vision engine. (Currently tested and working.)\
\
Helium_AI.pynb *will* be a jupyter notebook that contains a working sample of Helium web navigation functions to run in tandem with the Open AI text generator engine.
(Currently in development.)
